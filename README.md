Predicting Stock Price using Linear Regression
Recently, a lot of interesting work has been done in the area of applying Machine
Learning Algorithms for analyzing price patterns and predicting stock prices and index
changes. Most stock traders nowadays depend on Intelligent Trading Systems which help
them in predicting prices based on various situations and conditions, thereby helping
them in making instantaneous investment decisions.
Stock Prices are considered to be very dynamic and susceptible to quick changes because
of the underlying nature of the financial domain and in part because of the mix of known
parameters (Previous Days Closing Price, P/E Ratio etc.) and unknown factors (like
Election Results, Rumors etc.)
An intelligent trader would predict the stock price and buy a stock before the price rises,
or sell it before its value declines. Though it is very hard to replace the expertise that an
experienced trader has gained, an accurate prediction algorithm can directly result into
high profits for investment firms, indicating a direct relationship between the accuracy of
the prediction algorithm and the profit made from using the algorithm.
